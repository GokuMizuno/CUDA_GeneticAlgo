This is an example CUDA Genetic Algorithm ripped and modified from my work at FTLPropulsion.  A lot of the deep work has been removed, and only a basic shell has been left.  This is a fully functional program, however.

<b>What is CUDA</b>
CUDA is a parallel computing architecture developed by NVIDIA to massively increase computation power by using CPU and GPU cores together as a heterogeneous system. 

This project aims at improving the performance of genetic algorithms by parallelizing it using CUDA and GPU.  It shows about a 20x decrease in the computation time as compared to its sequential implementation.
